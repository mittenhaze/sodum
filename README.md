~~# sodum (*So dumb!*)
A barebones text editor for Linux.

## Why?

I have ADHD so I wanted to eliminate as many distractions in Emacs as possible. Unfortunately I couldn't change everything I wanted. For example, I haven't found a way to turn off messages in the echo area. I also couldn't find any other text editor that I can configure to be "100% distraction free". This motivated me to make my own text editor.  
My main goal is personal use, but I hope you'll find it useful as well.

## How?

I follow [this](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) guide. It uses C, I try to translate it to Javascript.

## Goals and nongoals.

- It'll be CLI only.
- It'll be Linux only.
- It'll use Emacs shortcuts.
- It won't be configurable.
- It won't have syntax highlighting.

## Features.

It echoes the characters you type and quits on `Ctrl + D`.

## How to install?

Install Node on your favorite Linux distro, download `main.js`, then:

`$ node main.js`~~

At the time of writing I'm an absolute beginner in programming. Unfortunately building a text editor is way above my paygrade. I'm leaving this here as I don't want to erase my failed attempts.
